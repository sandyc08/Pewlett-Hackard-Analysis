# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the Analysis
##
Pewlett Hackard is expecting a large number of employees to either retire quite soon and needs to know how to plan ahead for those positions that will need to be filled. The purpose of these two analyses was to find the position titles of those future retirees across all departments, and to find those who PH could approach for their mentorship program, so they can help train their replacements.

Results
##
Through database queries analysis, I was able to find that:
-there are 72,458 employees that are retiring or retiring soon.
-the positions that have the highest number of future retirees are both the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions.

-there are 1,549 of those employees that would be eligible for the mentorship program.

Summary
There are 72,458  roles that would need to be filled in the upcoming "silver tsunami." Nearly half of that number are Senior positions. The ratio of qualified, retirement ready employees to mentor those two departments is a low at about 1 to 64 for Senior Engineers and 1 to 84 for Senior Staff. The other departments fare better with mentors available to train. After the wave of retirements, there could be much room for promotions of the non-senior positions that could help with mentoring and training incoming personnel.
