# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
##
Overview of the Analysis
##
Pewlett Hackard is expecting a large number of employees to either retire quite soon and needs to know how to plan ahead for those positions that will need to be filled. The purpose of these two analyses was to find the position titles of those future retirees across all departments, and to find those who PH could approach for their mentorship program, so they can help train their replacements.
